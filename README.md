## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

PhoneAudioLink uses a **hybrid architecture** combining Qt for UI and Windows Runtime (WinRT) for Bluetooth:

```
Phone (A2DP Source)
    ‚Üì Bluetooth
Windows 10 Native A2DP Sink
    ‚Üì AudioPlaybackConnection API
PhoneAudioLink (Qt + WinRT)
    ‚Üì
PC Speakers
```

### Key Technologies:

- **Qt 6** - Cross-platform UI framework
- **C++/WinRT** - Modern C++ projection for Windows Runtime
- **Windows.Media.Audio.AudioPlaybackConnection** - Native A2DP sink
- **Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceWatcher** - Bluetooth device discovery
- **Qt Bluetooth** - Additional device information

### What Windows Handles:
- ‚úÖ A2DP protocol negotiation
- ‚úÖ SBC audio codec decoding
- ‚úÖ Audio buffer management
- ‚úÖ Routing to output devices
- ‚úÖ Connection reliability

### What QT Handles:
- ‚úÖ Device discovery and selection
- ‚úÖ Connection management
- ‚úÖ User interface
- ‚úÖ Status notifications
- ‚úÖ Settings persistence

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Settings Available:

- **Maximize Bluetooth Compatibility** - Show all Bluetooth devices (not just phones)
- **Connect Automatically** - Auto-connect to last device on startup
- **Start Minimized** - Launch to system tray

Settings are saved to `init.json` in the application directory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Media Controls
**Status:** Not implemented

When your PC acts as an A2DP Sink (receiving audio), the play/pause/forward/back buttons don't control phone playback. This is an **architectural limitation** of the Bluetooth A2DP Sink profile, not a bug.

**Workaround:** Use your phone's physical controls for playback (for now).

**Technical Reason:** Media control requires AVRCP Controller implementation, which is a separate Bluetooth profile that will require significant additional development (~1000+ lines of protocol code). Expect this to take a while to implement!

### Audio Codec
**Status:** SBC only

Windows 10's native A2DP Sink only supports the SBC (Subband Coding) codec. Higher-quality codecs (AAC, aptX, LDAC) are not available.

**Audio Quality:** Good enough for most use cases (music, podcasts, videos).

### Platform Support
**Status:** Windows only

This implementation uses Windows-specific APIs (WinRT) and cannot be ported to Linux or macOS without complete reimplementation using platform-specific Bluetooth stacks.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "WinRT not initialized"
- **Cause:** Not using MSVC compiler or Windows SDK not installed
- **Fix:** Ensure using MSVC (not MinGW) and install Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0+

### "No such interface supported"
- **Cause:** Device not properly paired or outdated Windows version
- **Fix:** Pair device in Windows Settings, ensure Windows 10 2004+

### "Device not found"
- **Cause:** Device not paired or Bluetooth turned off
- **Fix:** Pair device in Windows Settings ‚Üí Bluetooth & devices

### Audio choppy or cutting out
- **Cause:** Bluetooth interference or distance
- **Fix:** Move phone closer to PC, remove obstacles, disable other Bluetooth devices

### Can't build project
- **Cause:** Wrong compiler or missing dependencies
- **Fix:** Use MSVC compiler, install Qt with MSVC support, install Windows SDK
